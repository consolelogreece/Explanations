App Settings

-------
key
App Settings = AS
-------

AS contains data in key value pairs. 
	For instance:
		"myKey": "myValue"
		Accessing the AS.myKey would return "myValue".
	This is typically used to store things such like:
		User secrets.
		DB connection strings.
		Environment variables.

To access AS from you asp net core project, a service "IConfiguration" can be used; you can use it like dictionary, i.e. _config["myKey"].

Note: If there is an environment specific AS file, such as "appsettings.Development.json", the config stored here will overwrite the general AS file if that environment is being used.
